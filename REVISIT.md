## Protocol Application Enhancements

**Added:** 2025-11-16

**Current Behavior:**
- Protocols automatically apply to all farrowings when active
- All active "farrowing" protocols apply to every farrowing event
- Tasks are tied to farrowing/sow, not individual piglets

**Potential Enhancements:**
1. **Manual Protocol Selection**
   - Allow user to choose which protocol(s) to apply when recording a farrowing
   - Checkbox or dropdown during farrowing recording

2. **Per-Piglet Task Application**
   - Apply tasks to individual piglets instead of the entire litter
   - Better tracking for operations done on specific piglets

3. **Conditional Protocols**
   - Apply different protocols based on conditions:
     - Indoor vs outdoor farrowings
     - Different breeds
     - Seasonal variations
     - Farm location/building

**Why Deferred:**
- Current auto-application works well for standard operations
- Want to test current system before adding complexity
- Need real-world usage feedback to determine best approach
